Oh, look at the time!

I forgot the password to my blog. 🙃 And the email I used. But I finally successfully reset it so I can actually, y'know, *blog.*

### 💭 Current Obsessions

1. Water 💦 
   I've managed, for the most part, to cut out all sodas and juices from my life. RIP. Good alternatives for when I'm *dying* for a soda? **Sparkling Ice.** I do have a small cup of coffee in the morning during the weekday but we're titrating the amount of sugar and carbs I'm intaking, so currently no sugar but tons of non-dairy creamer, which apparently has a ton of carbs. 😩 Hubby bought me the **CUTEST** stainless steel coffee mug from Target tonight so I'm super excited to use it. It's a floral pattern on a creamy yellow background.

2. Watermelon Sugar 🍉 🎧
   It's Harry Styles. **Enough SAID.**

3. Computer Science Fundamentals
   Since Friday after work I've been consuming book after book on Computer Science, specifically on Data Structures and Algorithms. I've been getting into **Hacker Rank** and **Code Signal** practice problems but they are hard AF. Time to hit the books. 🤷🏻‍♀️

   I have four really good books that I'm reading plus a good video series on Udemy by my fave technical instructor:

   1. 📚 A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Edition 2 · by Jay Wengrow · Aug 2020 · Pragmatic Bookshelf · [Apple](https://books.apple.com/us/book/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and/id1535274624) · [Google](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?pcampaignid=books_read_action&id=dg4CEAAAQBAJ) (Currently $39.99 at both stores)
   2. 📚 Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms: Edition 2 · by Loiane Groner · Jun 2016 · Packt Publishing Ltd · [Apple](https://books.apple.com/us/book/learning-javascript-data-structures-and-algorithms/id1090634932?ign-gact=1) [Google](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?pcampaignid=books_read_action&id=kvxvDQAAQBAJ) (More expensive at Apple for $35.99)
   3. 📚 The Self-Taught Computer Scientist: The Beginner's Guide to Data Structures & Algorithms · by Cory Althoff · 2021 (print)
   4. [Newline.co's *JavaScript Algorithms*](https://www.newline.co/books/javascript-algorithms/welcome)
   5. ⏯ \*\*The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures\*\* by Stephen Grider on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure)
4. NailBoo

   I've been dipping my nails for like two months now? I LOVE it honestly. It's a little bit of a tiny learning curve, and they still come out not as clean-looking in my opinion (user error) than traditional nail polish, but they last! Today I got the Dark Dreams pigment, which comes out black but looks very dark gray in the bottle. I'm starting to get quite the collection, so I'm super excited about them. My other favorite is Pink Lemonade, which has a glitter quality but it's not very opaque.

### ☔️ Some unfortunate discoveries I've made this weekend:

1. There's no diabetic-friendly ice cream on the market that I've found yet.

   Hubs is trying to talk me out of making my own, and I'm still currently titrating the amount of carbs I can consume, so this is kind of silly to attempt right now. I'm thinking of using stevia as a sweetener along with vegan milk, so I'm sure it's possible.

2. I'm old.

   I fell in my office/spare bedroom this week 🙈 I had a bunch of junk on the floor and my office chair got caught on this laminate my mom had put down when she initially visited. I tilted back in my chair until that moment of panic set in where I realized I was tilted back further than I normally do... aaand I fell over, chair along with me. Got a tiny little concussion, a tiny little bruise on my elbow, and a bruised rib. Had to make sure it wasn't fractured or broken. Now I'm on some sort of corticosteroid (Prednisone) for the pain and various points of swelling. Just when the headaches for the sugar withdrawals had gone away, I give myself a goose egg and now it'll take several weeks for this concussion to heal. Genius. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Oh, and I can't work out for 3-4 weeks while my rib heals.

### 🎉 Happy News!

1. Diabetes update

   I've gotten a couple of new things on the medical front:  Right now I have a trial for the FreeStyle Libre 2 (which I have to replace tomorrow since it's been 2 weeks already for the first one, *yay*) and the down side is that I have to manually check the monitor to find out my level) but I have a prescription for the DexCom G6 so I'm trying to track down where to appeal to my insurance if I need to. At this point I don't even know what the status is so back to hunting it down again tomorrow. *siiiiiiigh* On another note, I should be getting a new, non-Ozempic but Ozempic alternative tomorrow and it's also an injectable to help suppress my appetite and do diabetes-related stuff to my bloodstream. Much. Excites.

2. UF Acceptance Status

   Still undetermined, but I'm kind of leaning towards continuing the self-learning trajectory I've been on for the past, oh, twenty years? There's this fellowship I've been preparing for (hence all the computer science study) so I'm excited to see where it goes. One of my career mentors is super excited about it for me too, so that's a good sign!

3. Volunteer Opps!!

   I have a meeting with the founder of a volunteer community tomorrow so I'm VERY excited to see what happens tomorrow! Hopefully I won't go more than a couple days without an update!
