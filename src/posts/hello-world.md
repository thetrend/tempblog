Well, I finally did it!!!! I finally threw together a blog! I realize that I need to stop trying to reinvent the wheel when I can literally just... *do the thing* and use a tested, public blog platform. I still made some tiny tweaks (this background is how dark my soul is) but I'm overall happy with this super basic theme. **Bonus:** I can blog from my phone. Mwahahaha. Laziness at its finest.

So to catch all three of you up who have not already read my facebook (I'm hoping to brain dump on this blog instead of facebook from now on), I found out yesterday that I do, in fact, have diabetes. *Bad, bad grace.* There are upsides to this, however. I don't need to check my glucose levels with a pin prick, but I do get headaches after I eat which means my glucose levels are going up, up, up. No meds to add except for a long term statin to make sure I don't have organ probz in the future, like when I'm 45. I will be starting this new medication called *Ozempic* to help me manage weight loss since I cannot, for the life of me, lose weight with all the psych (anti-depressant/anti-anxiety/ptsd/etc) meds I take. This does also mean serious lifestyle changes, which I'm excited about honestly. R and I have been trying to lose weight forever and we've had fits and starts with progress and changes, but this will hopefully be the boot in the ass that I needed to really stick to it.

With that said, we've been doing OMAD -- One Meal a Day -- and that's been going pretty well. Most of the time though I do have to have either a giant lunch or a medium lunch and a light dinner or else I run the risk of passing out. With that and the smart scale I have, plus my LoseIt subscription, Apple Fitness nonsense, and our apartment complex's gym, I should make decent headway to getting healthier.

Bleg, it's midnight. More thoughts to come later.
